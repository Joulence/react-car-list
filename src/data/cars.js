The first-generation Boxster (the 986) was introduced in late 1996; it was powered by a 2.5-litre flat six-cylinder engine. The design was heavily influenced by the 1993 Boxster Concept. In 2000, the base model was upgraded to a 2.7-litre engine and a new Boxster S variant was introduced with a 3.2-litre engine. In 2003, styling and engine output was upgraded on both variants."

        description: "Curtains up for the Bugatti Divo. At the exclusive automotive event 'The Quail: A Motorsports Gathering' in Monterey, California, Bugatti has presented its latest model as a world premiere. With the Divo, the French luxury brand has developed a super sports car tuned for agility, nimbleness and optimum handling performance on winding roads. It is powered by Bugatti's iconic eight-litre W16 engine with a power output of 1,500 PS. The aerodynamics of the model have been intensively fine-tuned and the suspension and chassis settings have been modified. As a result, the Bugatti Divo is 35 kilograms (77 lbs) lighter and has 90 kilograms (198 lbs) more downforce than the standard Chiron. The lateral acceleration of the Divo has been boosted to 1.6 g. Its maximum speed is limited to 380 km/h (236 mph). The Divo can lap the Nardò handling circuit in southern Italy eight seconds faster than the Chiron. The series will only consist of 40 vehicles. Upon the start of presentations to selected customers, the strictly limited small series, with a net unit price of €5 million, sold out immediately. It was therefore decided to build a super sports car with a different character from the Chiron which would still be immediately recognizable as a Bugatti.With the Divo, Bugatti is also reviving its coachbuilding tradition.In its first few decades, the French luxury brand had considerable success with bodies built to its own design and installed on existing chassis."

But it had two problems: the McLaren F1 and the car built to defeat it, the Porsche 911 GT1. So to beat both of them, the three-pointed star brand secretly bought a racing McLaren F1, stripped it down, and the engineers learned how to build a better vehicle. The chassis was developed by Lola Composites in the U.K., while AMG prepared the engine. When the car was ready, it raced in the 1997 season and won the inaugural season of the FIA GT Championship with Bernd Schneider, and it did it again in the following year. But the world motorsports federation insisted on getting the production vehicles, so Mercedes-Benz commissioned AMG to build them in their manufacturing plant from Affalterbach."
